# Jake Schoolmeesters - 2019 November personal changelog

## Overview:
I am commiting to tracking my personal development using this repo. I am planning on continuing to read Atomic Habits, which I started reading, but have not finished. I want to track my bicycle commuting miles, using Strava to track the distance each time. I will track my workouts, with a goal to be at the gym 3-4 days a week. And in the spirit of technology, I'm planning to begin learning Drupal/PHP, as there has been a lot of new work coming in at my job that is Drupal based and I would like to be able to help out there when possible.
